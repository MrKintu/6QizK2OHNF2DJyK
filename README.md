# Genetic Algorithm Implementation for Optimization

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve optimization problems. The GA mimics the process of natural selection to evolve solutions over generations. Key features of the notebook include:

Parameter Definition: The notebook defines parameters for grid search, including elite percentages and mutation rates.
Population Initialization: It initializes a population of potential solutions.
Selection, Crossover, and Mutation: The core GA operations are implemented to evolve the population towards optimal solutions.
Visualization: The results of the GA process are visualized to show the evolution of solutions over generations.
